# 🚨 Disaster Response Coordination Hub (DRCH)

> **An AI-Powered, Multi-Modal Emergency Incident Triage, Clustering, and Dispatch Platform for the Indian Disaster Management Ecosystem (NDMA / IRS / ERSS 112).**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Disaster Response Coordination Hub (DRCH)** is a unified mission-critical emergency coordination system designed to solve high-stress triage bottlenecks during localized and large-scale catastrophes. 

By ingesting real-time signals across **Social Media (in 22 scheduled Indian languages & Hinglish)**, **ERSS 112 Emergency Call Volume Spikes**, **Drone/UAV Aerial Reconnaissance**, and **NDMA SACHET XML CAP Early Warnings**, DRCH uses GenAI and spatiotemporal algorithms to:
1. **Filter noise & false alarms** from harsh weather sensor degradation or spam within 10 seconds.
2. **Deduplicate and cluster** multi-source reports into unified incidents (eliminating duplicate alerts for first responders).
3. **Assign dynamic priority scores** mapped directly to the **NDMA Incident Response System (IRS)** guidelines.
4. **Dispatch resources** via specialized role-based views (Field Medics, Firefighters, Logisticians) with interactive live GIS mapping, real-time tactical chat, and offline-first capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide (Local Development Setup)

### Prerequisites
- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/) installed
- [Node.js (v18+)](https://nodejs.org/) & [Python (v3.10+)](https://python.org/)
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Siddhcreator-1706/IT314_Software_Project.git
cd IT314_Software_Project
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your LLM API keys, DB credentials, and mock ports
```

### 3. Database Initialization (Migrations & Seed Data)
When setting up locally or connecting to a remote PostgreSQL/Neon database, apply the schema migration and baseline seed data:

```bash
# Using psql with your DATABASE_URL:
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f backend/db/migrations/01_schema.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f backend/db/seeds/seed_data.sql
```
*Note: In local Docker Compose, `01_schema.sql` is automatically mounted into `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`.*

### 4. Launch the Entire Platform (Local Docker)
Since the project is containerized, you can launch the Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, Python AI workers, and all local infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ) with a single command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 5. Access the Applications & Health Endpoints
Once the services are running, access:
- **Frontend (Web Client & Tactical Portals):** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend API Docs (Swagger UI):** `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- **System Health Diagnostics:**
  - Liveness: `http://localhost:8000/health`
  - Readiness & Service Probe (DB, Redis, RabbitMQ): `http://localhost:8000/health/ready`
- **RabbitMQ Management Dashboard:** `http://localhost:15672` (guest/guest)

## 🌐 Production Deployment Architecture

The platform supports both multi-cloud serverless deployment and fully containerized production orchestration:

### Option A: Cloud / Managed Services (Recommended)
- **Frontend:** Hosted on **Vercel** (`frontend/`) with change-detection filtering via `vercel.json` and `vercel-ignored-build.sh`.
- **Backend API:** Hosted on **Render** using `render.yaml` with auto-deployments, containerized runtime, and health check probes at `/health`.
- **Database:** Hosted on **Neon Serverless PostgreSQL** with PostGIS enabled.
- **Cache & Message Broker:** **Upstash Redis** and **CloudAMQP** (RabbitMQ).

### Option B: Self-Hosted Production Docker Compose
To deploy the full stack against external cloud databases/queues using production containers:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
```

### 🔄 CI/CD Automation & Security Gates
Every commit and pull request against `main` runs through the automated pipeline ([`.github/workflows/ci_cd.yml`](.github/workflows/ci_cd.yml)):
1. **Frontend Check:** Node.js 20 & ESLint.
2. **Python Check:** Ruff linter + Bandit static security analysis (SAST).
3. **Database Integrity:** PostgreSQL 16 + PostGIS schema validation and cryptographic audit chain hash verification.
4. **Backend Tests:** Pytest unit test execution.
5. **Security & Artifacts:** Single-pass Docker builds scanned by **Aqua Security Trivy** (blocking critical vulnerabilities) and published to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.
6. **CD Gate:** Automated deployment readiness verification.

## 🤝 Contributing to DRCH

We welcome contributions from all 10 team members! To keep our codebase clean and organized, please follow these guidelines:

1. **How to Decide What to Work On:**
   - Cross-reference the **Team Roster** and **Phase-wise Roadmap** above.
   - Find an unassigned GitHub Issue matching your phase/role and assign it to yourself.
2. **Branching Strategy:**
   - Never commit directly to `main`. 
   - Create a new branch: `feature/<module>-<description>` (e.g., `feature/medic-dashboard`) or `bugfix/<description>`.
3. **Commit Messages:**
   - Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format (e.g., `feat(frontend): add map pins`, `fix(backend): resolve db crash`).
4. **Submitting a Pull Request (PR):**
   - Push your branch, open a PR against `main`, and link the Issue it resolves.
   - Request a code review from the Team Lead or a peer. Once approved and CI passes, it will be merged.
